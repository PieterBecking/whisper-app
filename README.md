```

### 2. Configure API Key

Set your OpenAI API key using one of these methods:

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Option B: Edit config.py**
```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Grant Permissions

The app requires several macOS permissions:

- Ensure the checkbox is enabled

#### Input Monitoring (May be required)
- Go to: **System Preferences ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Input Monitoring**
- Add Terminal (or your Python executable) if prompted

## üéØ Usage

### Running the App

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The app will run in the background and show:
```
üé§ Voice Transcriber initialized
üìã Shortcut: cmd+shift+space
üîÑ Press the shortcut to start recording...
üöÄ Voice Transcriber is running...
```

### Recording and Transcribing

1. **Start Recording**: Press `Cmd+Shift+Space` anywhere on your system
   - You'll see a notification: "üî¥ Recording started..."

2. **Stop Recording**: Press `Cmd+Shift+Space` again
   - The app will process the audio and show: "‚èπÔ∏è Processing transcription..."

3. **Auto-Paste**: The transcription will be automatically pasted wherever your cursor was when you first pressed the shortcut

1. Open any text editor, email, or chat app
2. Click where you want the transcription to appear
3. Press `Cmd+Shift+Space` to start recording
4. Speak your message
5. Press `Cmd+Shift+Space` to stop
6. The transcription appears automatically at your cursor

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
# Keyboard shortcut (default: Cmd+Shift+Space)
TOGGLE_SHORTCUT = {'cmd', 'shift', 'space'}

# Audio settings
SAMPLE_RATE = 16000  # Best for Whisper
CHANNELS = 1         # Mono recording

# Notifications
SHOW_NOTIFICATIONS = True  # Set to False to disable popups
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
- **"AccessibilityNotEnabled"**: Grant Accessibility permissions as described above
- **"Microphone access denied"**: Check Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone settings

### Audio Issues
- **"No audio input device"**: Check your microphone is connected and working
- **"Poor transcription quality"**: Ensure you're in a quiet environment and speak clearly

### API Issues
- **"Invalid API key"**: Check your OpenAI API key is correct and has credits
- **"Rate limited"**: Wait a moment between requests if you hit rate limits

### Installation Issues
- **"Module not found"**: Make sure all requirements are installed: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- **"Permission denied"**: You may need to install packages with `sudo` or use a virtual environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Running as Background Service

To run the app automatically on startup:

### Option 1: Add to Login Items
1. Open **System Preferences ‚Üí Users & Groups ‚Üí Login Items**
2. Add a script that runs: `cd /path/to/whisper && python3 main.py`

### Option 2: Create Launch Agent (Advanced)
Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.voicetranscriber.plist` with appropriate plist configuration.

## üìù Technical Details
